[Pulse-width modulation (PWM)](https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/pulse-width-modulation) is a method where of transmitting a digital signal in the form of pulses to control analog circuits.
With PWM on a _board_, the continuous digital signal output by a GPIO pin is sampled at regular intervals and transmitted to any [hardware components](/components/) wired to the pin that read analog signals.
This enables the board to communicate with these components.
